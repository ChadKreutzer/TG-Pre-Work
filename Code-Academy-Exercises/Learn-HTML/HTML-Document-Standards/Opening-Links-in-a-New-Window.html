<!--This one is interesting because I always thought this was the polite thing
to do: If the link is to an external site open a new tab/window for the link so
that it is easier to get back to where you started. But more recently I've
read/heard on podcasts that this is now frowned on because people want to control
what tabs they have open and if they want a new tab/window, they will right
click the link thankyouverymuch. I guess this is true, but what about users who
are not savvy enough to know that is an option? Or ones like me that don't want
to have to do extra steps? I have more often been burned by the "dammit, I have
to go back and right click cause I wanted to keep that page open than by the
"dammit, I didn't want another tab open."-->
