<!--This lesson continues the pattern of having the learner use an element and-->
<!--then explaining it later with divs. As I said before divs are super useful-->
<!--and you see them all the time, but HTML5 has introduced semantic elements-->
<!--which are more informative about the intended structure of the page and can-->
<!--sometimes be better to use than a div-->
