/* I love const. I think it is probably from my dabbling in functional
programming. I just think it is safer and more consistent than using let
and it tends to enforce better program desgin if you are not changing your
variable willy nilly. That being said, I'll do whatever is called for by the
style guide of where I work once I get a job in the field */
